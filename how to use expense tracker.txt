To use the Expense Tracker application, follow these instructions:

Adding Expenses:

Run the expense_tracker.py script using Python.
You'll be presented with a menu showing options:
Expense Recording System
1. Add Expense
2. View Summary
3. Exit
Choose option 1 to add an expense.
Enter the amount spent, a brief description, and the category of the expense when prompted.
Repeat this process to add multiple expenses.
Viewing Summary:

Choose option 2 from the main menu to view the summary of your expenses.
The summary will display the total amount spent and a breakdown by categories.
Exporting Expenses to Excel:

Currently, the application does not directly support exporting expenses to Excel.
However, you can modify the save_expenses() function to export the data to an Excel file instead of a JSON file. You can use libraries like openpyxl or pandas to achieve this.


The application stores expense data persistently in a JSON file named expenses.json. This means your expense data will be retained even if you close the application and reopen it later.
Error Handling:

The application includes basic error handling to handle unexpected user inputs and file operations.
If you encounter any errors, the application will display informative error messages to guide you on how to proceed.
Exiting the Application:

To exit the application, choose option 3 from the main menu.
Your expense data will be saved automatically before the application exits.



----> Here's a brief explanation of the data structures and algorithms used in the Expense Tracker implementation:

Data Structures:

Lists: Python lists are used to store the expense_data. Each expense entry is represented as a dictionary and appended to this list.
Dictionary: Dictionaries are used to store individual expense entries. Each entry contains keys such as "date", "amount", "description", and "category", with corresponding values.
File I/O: The json module is utilized for reading from and writing to a JSON file (expenses.json) to persistently store expense data.
Algorithms:

Add Expense: The add_expense() function allows users to add new expenses. It prompts the user to input the amount spent, description, and category. It then creates a dictionary representing the new expense and appends it to the expense_data list.
View Summary: The view_summary() function calculates and displays the total amount spent and a breakdown of expenses by category. It iterates over the expense_data list to compute these values.
Load and Save Expenses: The load_expenses() function reads expense data from the JSON file into the expense_data list when the program starts. The save_expenses() function writes the current expense_data list back to the JSON file to persist the data.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented to handle scenarios such as invalid user inputs or file operations. Error messages are provided to guide users on how to proceed.
These data structures and algorithms allow for efficient management of expenses within the application. The use of lists and dictionaries provides a flexible and scalable way to store and manipulate expense data, while file I/O operations ensure that the data is persisted across multiple program runs.
